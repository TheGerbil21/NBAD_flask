        <p class="text-secondary">Hello, my name is Jeffrey Lee and I'm a senior at Del Norte High School. I've always wanted to learn about Computer Science, and have been learning so many interesting concepts from this class. I'm super interested in majoring in mechanical engineering, and this class will help me achieve my goals as well as teach me problem solving skills that will be useful in anything I pursue in the future.</p>
